TODO LIST FOR SLUDGE (rough roadmap)

✓ 1.  Hard-code adding files straight into Transactions DB (just dupe, no stress)
✓ 2.  Create classification IDs with ancillary data (int ID that correlates to a particular named bucket, with target level, zero date and periodicity)
✓ 3.  Hard-code base list of buckets
✓ 3a. Add RESTful API for retrieving transactions (expressjs.com, apiary.com?)
✓ 4.  Create basic UI for classifying transactions
✓ 5.  Add basic UI for importing files
✓ 6.  Report on current vs. expected bucket size.
✓ 6a. Add support for storing the account and other group info per-transaction
✓ 6b. Transactions are displayed in pageable form, most recent first
✓ 6c. Add filter bar above transactions to permit filtering and searching on any field

--- BASIC FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE (DEMONSTRATABLE)

✓ 7.  Create basic-case handler for import overlaps
  8.  Visualise in some way completeness of transaction record.

--- USABLE WITH SOME ASSISTANCE

✓ 9.  Create table holding ordered rules for classifying transaction (regex text match?)
✓ 10. Automate classification to bucket where a matching rule is found
✓ 11. Create basic UI for adding and editing buckets
✓ 11a. Create bucket import/export endpoints and UI for editing buckets externally

--- USABLE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE

✓ 11b. Host in AWS
  12. Reverse-engineer mobile app protocols to permit automatic transaction retrieval
  13. Investigate Yodlee feeds
  14. Mobile-enable classifier
✓ 15. Integrate Google authentication

--- BUGS / FEATURES

Can't rename accounts
Add account balance, for reconciliation (zero with transaction)
Bucket balance does not auto-update on rule execution or categorisation
No UI for zeroing buckets to a transaction
✓ Categorising one bucket when filtering <None> does not update correctly (still dirty?)
Display global transaction / uncategorised count (defrag?)
Display filtered transaction / uncategorised count
Display slush total (total of all bucket balances)
Move upload/download buttons to hamburger
Notes field on transaction
Remove need to press Enter after selecting an item
Filter by amount
See when others are using it (incl. how long ago their last request was)
