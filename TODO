TODO LIST FOR SLUDGE (rough roadmap)

1.  Hard-code adding files straight into Transactions DB (just dupe, no stress)
2.  Create classification IDs with ancillary data (int ID that correlates to a particular named bucket, with target level, zero date and periodicity)
3.  Hard-code base list of buckets
4.  Create basic UI for classifying transactions
5.  Add basic UI for importing files
6.  Report on current vs. expected bucket size.

--- BASIC FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE (DEMONSTRATABLE)

7.  Create basic-case handler for import overlaps
8.  Visualise in some way completeness of transaction record.

--- USABLE WITH SOME ASSISTANCE

9.  Create table holding ordered rules for classifying transaction (regex text match?)
10. Automate classification to bucket where a matching rule is found
11. Create basic UI for adding and editing buckets

--- USABLE BY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE

12. Reverse-engineer mobile app protocols to permit automatic transaction retrieval
13. Investigate Yodlee feeds
14. Mobile-enable classifier
15. Integrate Google authentication
