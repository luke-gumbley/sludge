TODO LIST FOR SLUDGE (rough roadmap)

✓ 1.  Hard-code adding files straight into Transactions DB (just dupe, no stress)
✓ 2.  Create classification IDs with ancillary data (int ID that correlates to a particular named bucket, with target level, zero date and periodicity)
✓ 3.  Hard-code base list of buckets
✓ 3a. Add RESTful API for retrieving transactions (expressjs.com, apiary.com?)
✓ 4.  Create basic UI for classifying transactions
✓ 5.  Add basic UI for importing files
✓ 6.  Report on current vs. expected bucket size.
✓ 6a. Add support for storing the account and other group info per-transaction
✓ 6b. Transactions are displayed in pageable form, most recent first
  6c. Option to show only uncategorised transactions

--- BASIC FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE (DEMONSTRATABLE)

✓ 7.  Create basic-case handler for import overlaps
  8.  Visualise in some way completeness of transaction record.

--- USABLE WITH SOME ASSISTANCE

  9.  Create table holding ordered rules for classifying transaction (regex text match?)
  10. Automate classification to bucket where a matching rule is found
✓ 11. Create basic UI for adding and editing buckets
✓ 11a. Create bucket import/export endpoints and UI for editing buckets externally

--- USABLE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE

✓ 11b. Host in AWS
  12. Reverse-engineer mobile app protocols to permit automatic transaction retrieval
  13. Investigate Yodlee feeds
  14. Mobile-enable classifier
✓ 15. Integrate Google authentication
